# Task 1 Software configuration

### Subtask1 Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?


Many years ago I started my career in IT. 
Angular Core was called Angular 2.0, no one has switched to PHP7 yet, 
and js developers had to deal with callback hell. 
But I was not very lucky with projects and a year later I switched the focus 
of my activities to volunteering. For many years I helped shelters and 
homeless animals in my hometown.

But the war changed the plans of many Ukrainians.

After reviewing my IT journey, I realized that I was interested in:
* put everything in its place
* comply with all requirements
* do everything clearly and in order
* when the mechanism works like clockwork

**But at the same time, I still enjoy writing code!** 
And so I decided to study automation testing.

I haven't had a formal job for quite some time, 
which makes it hard to find a job now. 
That's why I hope to get an internship.

So thank you for this opportunity. 

Anna.
